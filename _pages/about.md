*:open_book:There is truth in Marshall McLuhan’s assertion that the one thing of which the fish is unaware is water, the very medium that forms its ambience and supports its existence. Similarly, communication, through language and other symbolic forms, comprises the ambience of human existence. The activities we collectively call communication - having conversations, giving instructions, imparting knowledge, sharing significant ideas, seeking information, entertaining and being entertained - are so ordinary and mundane that it is difficult for them to arrest our attention. James Carey in Communication as Culture: essays on media and society (1989).*

* I am passionate about understanding opinion dynamics especially the drivers of **opinions polarization**. 
* I am also interested in misinformation with a special focus on actors, reactance to misinformation policies on mainstream platforms and migration towards **alternative platforms** such as Telegram. 
* I am more and more interested in combining qualitative and quantitive methods.
