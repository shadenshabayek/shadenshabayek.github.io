*:open_book:There is truth in Marshall McLuhan’s assertion that the one thing of which the fish is unaware is water, the very medium that forms its ambience and supports its existence. Similarly, communication, through language and other symbolic forms, comprises the ambience of human existence. The activities we collectively call communication - having conversations, giving instructions, imparting knowledge, sharing significant ideas, seeking information, entertaining and being entertained - are so ordinary and mundane that it is difficult for them to arrest our attention. James Carey in Communication as Culture: essays on media and society (1989).*
