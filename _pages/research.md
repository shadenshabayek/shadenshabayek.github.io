* Hidden opinions: a behavioral foundantion for opinion polarization (2020).

**Abstract.** Nearly one third of the world population uses social media. But are all people equal on social media or do popular voices dominate the conversation? This paper widens the scope of analysis of opinion dynamic models by introducing a novel heuristic: individuals choose to express their opinion or hide it, as a function of their local popularity. Intuitively, individuals who hide their opinion could be interpreted as individuals who have a low popularity such that even if they speak-up (or tweet) they will not be heard. Local popularity captures the idea that immediacy causes higher influence. Locally popular individuals express their opinion and can interact with like-minded or ideologically-opposed peers, namely expression entails debates and discussions. In the presence of hidden opinions, I show that the interactions between locally popular individuals and the magnitude of their influence explains whether consensus or polarization prevails. The primary mechanism at play is that the influence structure allows for consensus of opinion locally but communication between ideologically opposed expressers lead to global disagreement. The main contribution of this paper is to provide a unifying theoretical framework to assess different long-run opinion patterns with a focus on the topology of the network. I provide a measure of polarization and I run simulations to show the extent to which the topology of the network affects long-run opinion patterns.

* [Targeting in social networks with anonymized information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.03122), joint with F. Bloch (2019).

**Abstract.** This paper studies whether a planner who only has information about the network topology can discriminate among agents according to their network position. The planner proposes a simple menu of contracts, one for each location, in order to maximize total welfare, and agents choose among the menu. This mechanism is immune to deviations by single agents, and to deviations by groups of agents of sizes 2, 3 and 4 if side-payments are ruled out. However, if compensations are allowed, groups of agents may have an incentive to jointly deviate from the optimal contract in order to exploit other agents. We identify network topologies for which the optimal contract is group incentive compatible with transfers: undirected networks and regular oriented trees, and network topologies for which the planner must assign uniform quantities: single root and nested neighborhoods directed networks.
