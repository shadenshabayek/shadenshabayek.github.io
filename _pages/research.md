* Hidden opinions: a behavioral foundantion for opinion polarization (2020).

**Abstract.** Nearly one third of the world population uses social media. But are all people equal on social media or do popular voices dominate the conversation? This paper widens the scope of analysis of opinion dynamic models by introduc- ing a novel heuristic: individuals choose to express their opinion or hide it, as a function of their local popularity. Intuitively, individuals who hide their opinion could be interpreted as individuals who have a low popularity such that even if they speak-up (or tweet) they will not be heard. Local popularity captures the idea that immediacy causes higher influence. Locally popular individuals express their opinion and can interact with like-minded or ideologically-opposed peers, namely expression entails debates and discussions. In the presence of hidden opinions, I show that the interactions between locally popular indi- viduals and the magnitude of their influence explains whether consensus or polarization prevails. The primary mechanism at play is that the influence structure allows for consensus of opinion locally but communication between ideologically opposed expressers lead to global disagreement. The main contribution of this paper is to provide a unifying theoretical framework to assess different long-run opinion patterns with a focus on the topology of the network. I provide a measure of polarization and I run simulations to show the extent to which the topology of the network affects long-run opinion patterns.

* [Targeting in social networks with anonymized information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.03122), joint with F. Bloch (2019).

**Abstract.** This paper studies optimal targeting when the planner knows the architecture of the network but not the identities of agents occupying different positions in the network. We analyze a situation where agents enjoy positive externalities from the actions of their neighbors and the
planner’s objective is to maximize the sum of utilities of all the agents. We show that the planner’s ability to discriminate among agents depends on the balance between in- and out-neighborhoods in the social network. When influence is reciprocal, the efficient mechanism is immune to joint misreporting by the agents, and the knowledge of the network architecture is sufficient for the planner to implement the first-best actions. When in- and out-neighborhoods
are imbalanced, pairs of players have an incentive to jointly misreport their identities. This situation arises when one agent influences all other agents, or when one agent is being influenced by all other agents. It also arises in hierarchical structures with nested neighborhoods where agents at lower tiers of the network are influenced by the same agents as agents at upper tiers who influence them.

* Strategic cultural migration with peer effects, joint with Alexia Lochmann (2020).

**Abstract.** This paper examines the role played by cultural identity and social contacts in self-selection into migration. On June 23rd, 1939 in Berlin, Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler signed an agreement that gave the German speaking South Tyrolean population in northern Italy an option: to leave their homeland (move to the Third Reich) and keep their culture, or to stay in their homeland and abandon their culture. We formalize a model where strategic households interact together and affect each others’ intentions-to-emigrate. Each household has a cultural type and can have two different sorts of interactions with other households: (i) interactions within their social circles and (ii) interactions with their geographic neighbors who own property. Households have an incentive to match the emigration decision of social contacts in order to avoid the loss of social capital, and mis-match the migration decision of their geographic neighbors to seize the opportunity of buying their property if they migrate. Relying on the recently digitized micro level household data we provide empirical evidence for our model. Using a 2SLS approach to address endogeneity in peer effects, we find that a stronger cultural connection towards the German culture and the emigration decision of the social acquaintances significantly increases the intentions-to-emigrate. We see that personal property as well as neighborhood property, on the other hand, significantly decrease the intentions-to-emigrate.
