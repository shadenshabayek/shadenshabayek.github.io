* :seedling: [crowdfarming](https://www.crowdfarming.com/fr): adopt a tree or a mustard field! 
* :monkey_face: Ishmael : "The [book](https://www.ishmael.org/books/the-book/) opens with a deceptively ordinary personals ad: **“Teacher seeks pupil. Must have an earnest desire to save the world.”** Seeking a direction for his life, a young man answers the ad and is startled to find that the teacher is a lowland gorilla named Ishmael, a creature uniquely placed to vision anew the human story. Ishmael's paradigm of history is startlingly different from the one wired into our cultural consciousness. For Ishmael, our agricultural revolution was not a technological event but a moral one, a rebellion against an ethical structure inherent in the community of life since its foundation four billion years ago. Having escaped the restraints of this ethical structure, humankind made itself a global tyrant, wielding deadly force over all other species while lacking the wisdom to make its tyranny a beneficial one or even a sustainable one."
